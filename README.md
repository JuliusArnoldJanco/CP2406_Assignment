# CP2406_Assignment
CP2406_Assignment Console based coding repo for Java.

The purpose of this simulator is to create a Java Object Oriented Programming (OOP) script that
allows a user (player) to drop road sections onto an area and to populate the roads with varying
vehicles. The actions of these vehicles after being generated are governed by Australian road rules
(left lane/stop at traffic lights/left lane turns into left lane etc.). The simulator needs to track car
positions as they travel, what speed they are travelling at, where the vehicle is in relation to another
cars position or traffic light distance and how many cars are in the simulator. Tests will be generated
to confirm that simulator conditions are being met during the development stage.
The simulator will contain the following:

● vehicle classes: car/bus/motorbike.
● All vehicle dimensions are dependent on the car class dimensions.
● The simulator needs to track vehicle position, traffic light state and road type
(straight/t-section/crossroads/end).
● Collision detection for side/front of vehicle. Back of one vehicle is the front position of another
vehicle, reuse front condition for back condition.
● Roads need to have directional traffic (later feature).
● Dialogue box & drag and drop functionality (later feature).
● Paint/draw cars as they move (update position) across the screen (later feature).
● Buttons (later feature).
● Vehicle counter (later feature).
● Grid to drop roads onto (later feature).
